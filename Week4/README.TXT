MiniProject: Vigenère Cipher
-----------------------------

Outcomes of completing  this module:-

Develop a program to break the Vigenère Cipher, a more complex version of the Caesar Cipher. Improved program in three stages: 
First decrypting messages where you know the language and key length, then adding the capability to handle messages with unknown key length, then extending the program to handle messages in a range of possible languages. Through this project, I was able to:

(1) to effectively use HashSet and HashMap.
(2) to expand an algorithm from solving a simpler problem to handle broader, more complex problems. 
(3) to design and modify program code involving a more complex collection of classes, methods, and data.
