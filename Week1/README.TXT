Outcomes of completing this module:-

Learn about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure. Implemented the ciphers, as well as how to break them. To solve these problems, I worked more with processing Strings, but also learn about arraysâ€”a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. Further was be able to: 

(1) combine Strings using concatenation.
(2) build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder.
(3) use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data. 
(4) refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles.
(5) and practice effective algorithm design.
