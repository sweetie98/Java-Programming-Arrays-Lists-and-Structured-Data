## About this Course
Build on the software engineering skills learned in “Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software” by learning new data structures. Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Java’s object-oriented features. At the end of the course write an encryption program and a program to break your encryption algorithm.

After completing this course, you will be able to:
1. Read and write data from/to files;
2. Solve problems involving data files;
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages); 
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList;
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems;
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.

### Week 1: Cryptography: Keeping Information Secret

## Note:
Codes run in a custom Bluej Java programming Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. If you have already downloaded a version of BlueJ, you will need to uninstall and download [this one](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php) to get the edu.duke library.
